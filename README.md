 Register Number : 212223220022
 
 AIM:
 
 To find the PEAS description for the given AI problem and develop an AI
 agent.
 
 Theory
 Medicine prescribing agent:
 Such this agent prescribes medicine for fever (greater than 98.5 degrees)
 which we consider here as unhealthy, by the user temperature input, and
 another environment is rooms in the hospital (two rooms). This agent has to
 consider two factors one is room location and an unhealthy patient in a
 random room, the agent has to move from one room to another to check
 and treat the unhealthy person. The performance of the agent is calculated
 by incrementing performance and each time after treating in one room
 again it has to check another room so that the movement causes the agent
 to reduce its performance. Hence, agents prescribe medicine to unhealthy.

 DESIGN STEPS
 STEP 1:Identifying the input:
 Temperature from patients, Location.
 STEP 2:Identifying the output:
Prescribe medicine if the patient in a random has a fever.
 PEAS description is developed by the performance, environment, actuators,
 and sensors in an agent.
 Treat unhealthy patients in each room. And check for the unhealthy patients
 in random room
 Measure the performance parameters: For each treatment performance
 incremented, for each movement performance decremented
